<p>MoonStress is a basic IP network hacking application. It is for ethical white hat hackers.</p>
<p>Its main utilities are the super easy open port checking part. By putting in a public IP and pressing one button you can see all open ports of an IP.</P>
<p> It is also used for firewall testing for its extreme rapid UDP packet sending part. </p> 
<p> You put in an IP and any open ports you find and it begins to send and send forever until the program is taskkilled!</p>
